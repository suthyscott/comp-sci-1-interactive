# 1

There is no input or changing value, so it's a constant time complexity

# 2

Once again, no changing value so it's constant. 

# 3

This time we have a single changing value, so this is O(n) or Linear. 

# 4

Once again, even though the first for loop is constant, the second loop has a single changing value. So this has a time complexity of O(n)

# 5

Back to constant, since we have no changing values. 

# 6

Two chaning values, meaning a runtime complexity of O(n squared)

# 7

Even though we have two for loops, only one of them has a changing value. O(n)

# 8 

A single changing value (the array itself) so O(n)

# 9

Constant. Performing a single operation, no iteration. O(1)

# 10

False. Constant runtime complexity might be slower at first, but when scaled up or in the worst case scenario, that constant will usually be faster. 

Think back on the plane vs modem scenario.
